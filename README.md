# Item Catalog Project
Item Catalog project is the fourth project for the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program.](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

## About the project: 
In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your users. 
You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. Then you'll learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

To accomplished this you'll develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
